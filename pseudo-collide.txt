collide(Particle A, Particle B)

find the tangent vector to their surfaces and call it tan
	vector sum, ensuring it will be perpendicular to one of the vectors of A or B
for particle that is not perpendicular:
	rotate coordinate plane so tan is in vertical direction
	y is held constant
	x will change such that momentum is conserved (x = -x if of equal velocity)
	re-rotate coordinate plane to original orientation
for the particle that is perpendicular:
	reverse direction of vector with respect to tan
	change will be such that momentum is conserved
